# myChat-PC-
A socket based chatting application for PCs

# Environment setup-
1. Maven framework is used.
2. It is strongly recommended that you use an IDE that supports the maven framework (eg - Eclipse, IntellIJ, etc).
3. Once that's figured out, clone the repository into your IDE directly using the repo link.
4. This project utilizes JavaFX to support the GUI.
5. For the JavaFX support, download the latest JavaFX library from https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
6. Once done downloading, head over to the download directory and extract the files into some place safe (C:\Program Files\Java or /home/user/.jdks)
7. From the IDE, import all the jars into the project build path and build the project.
8. If you encounter any error (like pipeline not found), then use '--module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-module javafx.base,javafx.controls,javafx.fxml' to the vm options of the Main.java file from 'Run Configuration' settings.
9. That should get you set up. In case you still face some error, contact me or visit www.stackoverflow.com
10. Happy Coding!
