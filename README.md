# myChatDesktop
A socket based chatting application for PCs

# Environment setup -
1. Maven framework is used.
2. It is strongly recommended that you use an IDE that supports the maven framework (eg - Eclipse, IntellIJ, etc).
3. Once that's figured out, clone the repository into your IDE directly using the repo link.
4. This project utilizes JavaFX to support the GUI.
5. For the JavaFX support, download the latest JavaFX library from https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
6. Once done downloading, head over to the download directory and extract the files into some place safe (C:\Program Files\Java or /home/user/.jdks)
7. From the IDE, import all the jars into the project build path and build the project.
8. If you encounter any error (like pipeline not found), then use '--module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-module javafx.base,javafx.controls,javafx.fxml' to the vm options of the Main.java file from 'Run Configuration' settings.
9. That should get you set up. In case you still face some error, contact me or visit www.stackoverflow.com
10. Configure the .gitignore file to include all the IDE specific setting so that they don't get uploaded to the repo when you push.
11. Happy Coding!

# Project Structure -
This project is divided in two parts. Part 1 handles the tasks associated with logging a user in or creating a new account. We call this part the Credential part. Part 2 handles all the tasks related to the main chat framework.

# Message Framework -
This project uses HashMap<String, Object> type of objects to communicate between the client and server or client and client. The different kinds of messages used are given below.

# Message types - 

(All the response messages already contain the query type from the request message in it, so I'm not rewriting them.)

1. Login Request - 
   This type of message is used between the client and the credential network. The purpose of this type of message is to let the server know that someone is trying to access the chat network and to log them in.
   This message has the following pattern ->
       [REQUEST -> FROM USER TO SERVER]
       1. Key - KEY_QUERY Value - QUERY_LOGIN_REQUEST => The header that tells the server someone is trying to log in.
       2. Key - KEY_USERNAME Value - USERNAME => Holds the username of the person trying to access.
       3. Key - KEY_PASSWORD Value - PASSWORD => Holds the hashed password that is validated against the password that is stored in the database.
       [RESPONSE -> TO USER FROM SERVER]
       4. Key - KEY_RESPONSE_CODE Value - RESPONSE_CODE_FAILURE/RESPONSE_CODE_SUCCESS => The response code tells the client whether their attempt to log in was successful or not.
       5. Key - KEY_RESPONSE_MESSAGE Value - MESSAGE => A message from the server regarding the response code in case the client wants to display it to the users. It varies for different kinds of failure.
   Once the login is successful, the user is re-directed to the chat network.

2. Signup Request -  
   This type of message is used between the client and the credential network. The purpose of this type of message is to let the server know that someone is trying to register themselves into the server.
   This message has the following pattern ->
       [REQUEST -> FROM CLIENT TO SERVER]
       1. Key - KEY_QUERY Value - QUERY_SIGNUP_REQUEST => The header that tells the server someone is trying to sign up to the server.
          (I skip the explanation of the next few lines since they are self-explanatory. If someone feels that they might want to fill it up then you are most welcome!)
       2. Key - KEY_USERNAME Value - USERNAME 
       3. Key - KEY_PASSWORD Value - PASSWORD
       4. Key - KEY_FIRST_NAME Value - FIRST_NAME
       5. Key - KEY_LAST_NAME Value - LAST_NAME
       6. Key - KEY_EMAIL Value - EMAIL
       [RESPONSE -> TO CLIENT FROM SERVER]
       7. Key - KEY_RESPONSE_CODE Value - RESPONSE_CODE_FAILURE/RESPONSE_CODE_SUCCESS => The response code tells the client whether their attempt to sign up was successful or not.
       8. Key - KEY_RESPONSE_MESSAGE Value - MESSAGE => A message from the server regarding the response code in case the client wants to display it to the users. It varies for different kinds of failure.
   Once the signup is successful, the user is redirected to the login screen

3. Handshake - 
   This type of message is used between the client and the chat network. The purpose of this message is to let the chat server know about the whereabouts of the client. This message gets send to the chat network as the very first message.
   This message has the following pattern ->
       [REQUEST -> FROM CLIENT TO SERVER]
       1. Key - KEY_QUERY Value - QUERY_HANDSHAKE => The header that tells the server that someone is trying to send their metadata to the server 
       2. Key - KEY_USERNAME Value - SENDER => The person who is sending the message
       [RESPONSE -> TO CLIENT FROM SERVER]
       3. Key - KEY_EXISTING_MESSAGES Value - A list of existing messages => A list of the previous messages is sent back to the user
   If successful, the  client moves on to the next segment of establishing the communication.

4. Client List Request- 
   This type of message is used between the client and the chat network. The purpose of this message is to get the list of active and inactive users from the server. The client sends this message to the chat network to fetch the list.
   This message has the following pattern ->
       [REQUEST -> FROM CLIENT TO SERVER]
       1. Key - KEY_QUERY Value - QUERY_CLIENT_LIST => Tells the server that the client is requesting for the client list.
       2. Key - KEY_USERNAME Value - USERNAME => The client who is requesting the client list.
       [RESPONSE -> TO CLIENT FROM SERVER]
       5. Key - KEY_ACTIVE_USERS_LIST Value - Active Users list => The server sends an arraylist of the number of clients that are currently active.
       6. Key - KEY_INACTIVE_USERS_LIST Value - Inactive Users list => The server sends an arraylist of the number of clients that are currently inactive.
   Once successful, the GUI in the client side is updated accordingly.

5. Client List Request(2) -
   This type of message is used between the client and the chat network. The purpose of this message is to get the list of active and inactive users from the server. The chat server sends this message all active clients if any user gets connected/disconnected.
   This message has the following pattern ->
       [RESPONSE -> TO CLIENT FROM SERVER]
       1. Key - KEY_ACTIVE_USERS_LIST Value - Active Users list => The server sends an arraylist of the number of clients that are currently active.
       2. Key - KEY_INACTIVE_USERS_LIST Value - Inactive Users list => The server sends an arraylist of the number of clients that are currently inactive.
   Once successful, the GUI in the client side is updated accordingly.

6. Text Message - 
   This type of message is used between clients on the chat network. The purpose of this message is simply to carry the message of one user to another via the chat server. This message both generates and ends in the client side.
   This message has the following pattern ->
       [REQUEST -> FROM CLIENT TO SERVER]
       1. Key - KEY_QUERY Value - QUERY_SEND_MESSAGE => Tells the server that someone wants to send a message.
       2. Key - KEY_MESSAGE Value - MESSAGE => The message that the user sends
       [RESPONSE -> TO CLIENT FROM SERVER]
       (The initial message gets sent to all the active users except the one who sends it. The server doesn't reply on this kind of query)
   Once successful, all the active users on the network receives the message sent.

# Running the app - 
   1. Create a runnable jar.
   2. java --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib--add-modules javafx.base,javafx.fxml,javafx.controls  -jar myChat.jar
